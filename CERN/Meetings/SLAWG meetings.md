2023-11-23 [SLAWG #73: Replacing the SPS ZS by bent crystals (brainstorm)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1334617/) 

2023-11-1 [SLAWG #74: Radiol. gical impact of ZS material choice](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1339052/) 
Helmut simulated the proton b. am hitting the ZS tanks (what is it?). He showed how the irradiation dose depend of the materials of the ZS. Aluminium anode irradiates 3-5 times lower dose depending on the place, than the steel one. Beryllium wires reduce the dose in the beginning of the tank by a factor of 5-6.5 depending on the point. The dose can be reduced by ~20 times.  

2023-10-4 [SLAWG #72: Predicting LSS2 activation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1313717/)   
Francesco used different ML models to predict the level of IR (induced radioactivity) in LSS2 (where is it?) on the basis of data collected for past 6 months. He managed to get the predictions with 9-11% error depending on the model.
