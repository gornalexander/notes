Slow extraction in SPS is momentum-driven. The main idea is similar to [[Literature#^547078|PIMM slow extraction]]. 
Initially the full beam is located in the stable region of phase space. Stable region around the beam is limited by separatrix. The separatrix shape is determined by sextupole and octupole strengths. It can be found from Kobayashi hamiltonian.
