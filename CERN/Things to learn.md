- Accelerator operation at 4.0×10^13 ppp (what is ppp?) - protons per pulse 
- What is Run 4? - SPS Run 4
- What is LS3?
Any general scheme of the project. Aim is to increase the intensity of the SPS beam (from what to what intensity?). There are issues with the beam transfer from beam transfer from TCC2 to TCC8 including radiation protection issues.
Beam intensity measure units?
What is the expected profit from the increase of the beam intensity?
What is going to be done: the total number of protons is increased or the emittance reduced?
